**📊 Multiple Linear Regression – 50 Startups Dataset**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project implements Multiple Linear Regression to predict the profit of startups based on their expenditures in:

R&D Spend

Administration

Marketing Spend

State (Categorical Variable)

The model is built using Python and standard machine learning libraries to analyze the relationship between investment factors and company profit.

**📂 Dataset Information**

File Name: 50_Startups.csv
Number of Records: 50
Number of Features: 5

**🔹 Features Description**
Column Name	Description
R&D Spend	Amount spent on Research & Development
Administration	Amount spent on Administration
Marketing Spend	Amount spent on Marketing
State	State in which the startup operates
Profit	Profit earned by the startup (Target Variable)

**🔹 Data Types**

Numerical: R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, Profit

Categorical: State

**🧠 Objective**

To build a Multiple Linear Regression model that:

Predicts startup profit

Analyzes the impact of different spending categories

Evaluates model performance using standard metrics

**⚙️ Technologies Used**

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualization)

Scikit-learn

**📈 Model Interpretation**

The regression model determines:

How much profit increases with increase in R&D Spend

The effect of Marketing Spend on profit

Whether Administration spending significantly impacts profit

Influence of startup location (State)

Generally, R&D Spend shows the strongest positive correlation with Profit.

**📊 Expected Outcome**

The model successfully predicts startup profit with good accuracy, demonstrating that investment in R&D significantly impacts profitability.

**📌 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Multiple Linear Regression in predicting business profit based on multiple independent variables. It provides insights into which factors most strongly influence startup success.
